# Project Report: Flight Reservation System

---

## 1. Requirement Documentation
The initial phase involved gathering comprehensive requirements for the Flight Reservation System. This included understanding user needs, system functionalities, and constraints. Requirements were documented to serve as a foundation for subsequent project phases.

## 2. Use Case Specification
Use case scenarios were outlined to define system interactions and behavior. Use case diagrams and narratives provided a detailed understanding of how users would interact with the Flight Reservation System.

## 3. Vision Document
The vision document was crafted to articulate the long-term goals and objectives of the Flight Reservation System. It encapsulated the overarching vision, objectives, scope, and guiding principles for the project.

## 4. SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
The Software Requirements Specification detailed the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. It provided a comprehensive guide for the development team, outlining what the system must accomplish and the constraints it must adhere to.

## 5. Requirement Validation through NASA's ARM Tool
NASA's ARM (Assurance and Robustness Manager) Tool was employed to validate and ensure the robustness of the project requirements. This step aimed at enhancing the reliability and quality of the software.

## 6. Design Creation (Screens)
The design phase involved creating screen designs for the Flight Reservation System. Utilizing design patterns such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), Abstract Factory, Singleton, Iterator, and Strategy, the architecture was conceptualized to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

## 7. Implementation
The actual coding and development of the Flight Reservation System were carried out in Java, following the principles of object-oriented programming. The chosen design patterns were implemented to address specific concerns such as separation of concerns, code reusability, and scalability.

## 8. Client's Review
A review session was conducted with the client to showcase the implemented features and gather feedback. This iterative process allowed for adjustments based on client input, ensuring alignment with user expectations.

## 9. Testing
Thorough testing procedures were conducted to identify and rectify bugs, ensuring the reliability and stability of the Flight Reservation System. Unit testing, integration testing, and system testing were employed to validate the functionality of individual components and the system as a whole.

## 10. Validation
The final phase involved validating the entire system against the initial requirements and design specifications. This comprehensive validation ensured that the Flight Reservation System met the intended objectives and conformed to the defined standards.

The implementation of design patterns and architecture principles played a crucial role in enhancing the robustness, maintainability, and scalability of the Flight Reservation System. The desktop-based application, although featuring a separation between frontend and backend, successfully achieved its goals in providing efficient flight reservation services.
